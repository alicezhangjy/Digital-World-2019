my work for DW 2019 

no question paper attached

some of my comments for personal use are included, mostly for easy understanding and quick notes

For CHEM-DW, be sure to install mayavi on your anaconda prompt, and activate py35 so you cna visualise the 3d plots. else it wont work.
Disclaimer: I received a lot of help from my friends and seniors for Week 6 of ChemDW 2D for hydrogen wave function cause i couldn't deal with that modular coding and visualisation shit lmao.
